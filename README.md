# pybuster
A directory-busting tool written in Python.
This program requires a wordlist in the same directory. You can edit the WORDLIST constant to change the name to your preferred wordlist. 
I have also included a fun proof-of-concept for a program called Pycat, which uses Python to mimic some of the functions of Hashcat. It doesn't have nearly as many features, nor does it work as efficiently. But I had fun writing it.
